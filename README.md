## My process

First I started with writing html code, creating <div class="container"> as a parent of <div class="wrapper"> which holds the img and the text. Then it was time for CSS styles where i used Flexbox and basic css atributes to get my solution as closest as i could compared to the design. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned almost everything i wrote in this challange as it is my first ever project and it is totaly different than watching tutorials.


### Continued development

Do more projects and learn more from HTML and CSS and after i feel more confortable in these then im gonna start learning SCSS/SASS and JS.

### Useful resources
